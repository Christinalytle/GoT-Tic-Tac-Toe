Tic-Tac-Toe project for Front-End Bootcamp. I created a Game of Thrones-themed game using HTML/CSS, Bootstrap, and JQuery. 

I felt that I grew as a developer with this project - the assignment was to create a basic game, but I wanted to push myself and add pictures
and have the game keep score. I wanted this to be a worthwhile project in my portfolio. I spent many hours refactoring this and having the code be as clean as possible.


Here is the final product:
